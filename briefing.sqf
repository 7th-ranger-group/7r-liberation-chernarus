<font size='18'>Hostile and Civilian Scores</font>
<br />
<br/>
When you are at an FOB you will have the resources overlay on the ride side of
 your screen. In there at the bottom there are two percentages that are <b>critically important</b> to how the game should be played:
<br />
<br />
* Exclamation Mark (!) is the hostility level, we need to keep it low.
 Beyond 60% we need to consider doing sidemissions to lower it.
<br />
<br />
* The House Mark is the civilian score, a negative score means hostile guerella forces and IEDs
on the roads. We want to keep this score to a healthy positive, hearts and minds folks!
<br />
<br />
<font size='18'>Urban Combat Rules</font>
<br />
<br />
* 1. Do not use any type of heavy weapons in urban areas.
<br />
* 1.1 That includes GL weapons, 50cals or higher.
<br />
* 2. Do not blow up IEDs, disarm them.
<br />
* 3. Do not blow up civilian buildings, we lose civ score.
<br />
* 4. Mark cleared buildings.
<br />
* 5. After the area is clear search for and treat wounded civilians. They are highlighted
 on your GPS in a red circled area.
<br />

<br/>
<font size='18'>General Rules</font>
<br />
<br />
* 6. If a player asks you to cease fire inside an FOB you need to immediately comply.

<br/>
<font size='18'>Help New Members</font>
<br />
<br/>
7R offers a 24/7 dedicated community (Liberation or Antistasi) server for all of its members. One of the goals of this offering is to gradually train and ramp up new members into our squad’s way of operating and collaborating. So when you find new members on the community server:
<br />
<br />
* Talk to them, engage them in a conversation.
<br />
* Guide them through the rules and guidelines of the unit.
<br />
* Take them in your squad and behave more typical than you normally would (demonstrate how we operate).
<br />
<br />

<font size='18'>Follow your training</font>
<br />
<br />

If total anarchy is 0 (zero) and how 7R runs operations is 10, we should operate on the community server at a 7 or 8 level. That means:
<br />
<br />
* Form proper squads, decide on comms.
<br />
* Have a squad leader equipped with proper comms (152).
<br />
* Do not lonewolf.
<br />
* Use your training (bounding, peeling, CQB, etc).
<br />
<br />
<font size='18'>Communicate your intentions</font>
<br />
<br />
* Be responsive on long-range when on the server.
<br />
* Call out any actions that can impact other people’s operations.
<br />
* Mark cleared buildings on the map.
